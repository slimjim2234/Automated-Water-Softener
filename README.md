Automated-Water-Softener
========================

Automated water softener using an arduino, a relay, and code

The control unit broke so I made an alternative that responds with a couple of buttons to control a relay.  

The difficult part is making it automated.
The water softener has 5 different modes that require a specific time for each one to complete before moving on.
The relay controls the motor which turns a gear that selected the different modes of the water softener.

Take and modify as you wish, this is my working implementation of the software.
